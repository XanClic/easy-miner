Have you ever played some Minesweeper clone and wondered: “Hey, why do
I need two mouse buttons?  Can’t the game figure out whether that has
to be a mine or a safe field and then respectively set a flag or
unveil the field?”  If so, this might be just the thing for you.

This project’s motto is “Removing the whole point of Minesweeper”.
